# RescuePawsSite

Description
====================================================================================================
This is a platform for users to post pictures and descriptions of stray and abandonded animals.
We all are somewhat loving people who love to show our affection towards these pets. Unfortunately,
most of them get abandonded by cruel owners and there are some animals sufffering from diseases and
want our attention. This site is for those, who has a melting heart seeing these pain and want to 
do something for them.

What this site actually does
====================================================================================================
Users can Sign Up and Login to the site and post about a new pet. And add descriptive details like 
name, age, bio and image. They can update these details and also delete a record.
Users can see their posts by clicking 'My Pets'. And also see all the other pets that have been posted
by other users.

Future Scope
====================================================================================================
In the near future, I have planned to add a forum where users can post about anything related to
their pets, more like facebook, where users can discuss or share their topics. I have also planned
to add like and comment feature too. I will be adding more future scopes when I have actually fulfilled 
these things.
